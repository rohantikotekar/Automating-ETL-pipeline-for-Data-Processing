# Automating-ETL-pipeline-for-Data-Processing
Architected a scalable ETL pipeline leveraging Python for data extraction, PySpark for distributed data transfor-
mation, and PostgreSQL for eﬀicient storage and retrieval of large datasets.

Implemented Apache Airflow for advanced workflow orchestration, enabling dynamic scheduling, monitoring, and
alerting of ETL processes to ensure data pipeline reliability and eﬀiciency.

Optimized data processing performance by tuning PySpark operations, implementing partitioning strategies, and
leveraging parallel processing to reduce ETL runtime and enhance throughput.
